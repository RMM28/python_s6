Abstract

The Expense Tracker Project in Python is designed to assist individuals in managing their finances efficiently by tracking their expenses on a weekly and monthly basis. The application offers a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library, allowing users to easily input and categorize their expenses. 

Key features of the Expense Tracker include the ability to record expenses along with their respective amounts, categorize expenses into different spending categories, and visualize expenditure patterns over time. Additionally, the application provides functionalities for calculating total expenses incurred on a weekly and monthly basis.

The Expense Tracker Project employs OOP principles to organize code into modular components, enhancing readability and maintainability. Using Python's built-in data structures and file-handling capabilities assists in the storage and retrieval of data, ensuring a seamless user experience across sessions.

Through its intuitive interface and comprehensive functionality, the Expense Tracker Project empowers users to gain insights into their spending habits, make informed financial decisions, and maintain better control over their budgets. This project serves as a practical demonstration of Python programming concepts and GUI development.
